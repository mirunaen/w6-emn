#Create a function that receives as parameters a list and an element and returns a tuple with the
#positions of the element in the list, or the empty tuple if the element is not in the list. Invoking 
#this function, create another one that receives two lists and an element and returns if any of the
#appearances of the element is at the same position in both lists.
